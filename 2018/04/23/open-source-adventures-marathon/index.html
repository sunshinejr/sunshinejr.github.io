<p><span class="note">(This is a continuation of <a href="https://sunshinejr.com/2018/04/03/open-source-adventures-xiblint/">#1 - Xiblint</a>. You don&rsquo;t necessarily need to read the first part, but you&rsquo;ll get the general context for this one, so if you have some spare minutes I encourage you to read it first ;-)</span>
<br /><br />
When I finished all the necessary work for <strong>Danger JS</strong>, I could finally start working on the <strong>DangerXiblint</strong> plugin. And this lovely weekend started off great <a href="https://github.com/lyft/xiblint/pull/10">with my feature being merged to the official Xiblint repo</a>. I immediately started implementing some parts of the plugin and wanted to test it on my <span class="ab">CI<span class="abtext">Continous Integration</span></span>&hellip; And then I noticed that <strong>Danger Swift</strong> is not quite there yet on <strong>Xcode 9.3</strong>&hellip;</p>

<p><center><img src="img/danger_swift_not_working.png" style="width: 500pt;" alt="Danger Swift not working issue..." /></center></p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s fix <strong>Danger Swift</strong> first, I thought!
<br /><br /></p>

<h1 id="danger-swift">Danger Swift</h1>

<p>I was trying to think about a possible cause of the problem and the first thing that popped in my mind was <strong>Danger JS &lt;-&gt; Danger Swift</strong> compatibility, as we made a lot of big releases lately. The other option could be a breaking change that happened in <strong>Swift 4.1</strong>, although it shouldn&rsquo;t be the case as it was a minor release. Whatever it was, it seemed like a quick fix.</p>

<p>First, I&rsquo;ve made a <a href="https://github.com/Moya/Harvey/pull/22"><span class="ab">PR<span class="abtext">Pull Request</span></span> on Harvey</a> to see what errors do we got on our CI:</p>

<p><img src="img/danger_swift_error.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>This meant that the command that we use to build underlying packages was using an option that was removed from the newest Swift. And after a research, indeed, that was the case:</p>

<p><center><img src="img/redundant_enable_prefetching.png" style="width: 500pt;" alt="Removed --enable-prefetching flag from SPM" /></center></p>

<p><a href="https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-6750">As it turned out</a>, the flag <code>--enable-prefetching</code> was already a default behaviour and it was redundant, thus removed.</p>

<p>Now I needed to find <em>where</em> did we use this flag in <strong>Danger Swift</strong>. I couldn&rsquo;t find it in a project or the whole workspace&hellip; And all of a sudden things got interesting. I needed to go <em>deeper</em>.</p>

<p><img src="img/deeper.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>I remembered that <strong>Danger Swift</strong> uses <a href="https://github.com/JohnSundell/Marathon">Marathon</a> for resolving underlying packages and configuration file. After a quick search, the flag was indeed in Marathon&rsquo;s sources. This meant working on completely new environment and I couldn&rsquo;t be more excited about it!
<br /><br /></p>

<h1 id="marathon">Marathon</h1>

<p>Marathon is an abstraction layer over <strong>Swift Package Manager</strong>. It&rsquo;s quite popular as it makes scripting in <strong>Swift</strong> pretty easy. And as it&rsquo;s popular, I knew that someone had to encounter the same problem I had so I searched through issues and PRs first. And of course <a href="https://github.com/JohnSundell/Marathon/pull/161">John was already working on the PR</a>:</p>

<p><center><img src="img/PR_fixing_marathon.png" style="width: 500pt;" alt="John Sundell already fixing Marathon in a PR" /></center></p>

<p>It seemed like the PR is almost complete: only two tests were failing and people were saying that it works on their machines.
I cloned the repo and ran the test - it seemed to work on my machine as well. Unfortunately, tests on <strong>CI</strong> were still broken, days were passing by, and people couldn&rsquo;t use both <strong>Marathon</strong> and <strong>Danger Swift</strong> on the newest <strong>Xcode</strong>. In that case, many owners could say that the <em>&ldquo;CI is broken&rdquo;</em> and merge it under the pressure of the community. But John did an excellent job and didn&rsquo;t merge it until the fix was there. I wanted to help and move things forward, so I started digging.</p>

<p>The CI was running on Linux, so I knew where to start. I&rsquo;ve installed Swift 4.1 toolchain on my <strong>Ubuntu</strong> server using <a href="https://swiftenv.fuller.li/en/latest/">SwiftEnv</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/JohnSundell/Marathon#on-linux">followed the instructions on how to build &amp; run the tests on Linux</a>. Readme of Marathon is fantastic and it got me up and running quickly.</p>

<p>I ran the tests on my server and (un)fortunately they failed - we were on the right track. Now I had an environment where I reproduced the case each time and had a quick feedback loop on it (where on CI it would take ages to fix).</p>

<h1 id="finding-the-problem">Finding the problem</h1>

<p>One of the dependencies of Marathon, <a href="https://github.com/JohnSundell/Releases">Releases</a>, had two warnings that could possibly be the reason of failure. I fixed both of these and created the PR:</p>

<p><center><img src="img/releases_fix.png" style="width: 500pt;" alt="Fixing Releases" /></center></p>

<p>Unfortunately, even after the fix, the tests were failing.</p>

<h1 id="debugging-on-linux">Debugging on Linux</h1>

<p>Debugging a Swift script on remote Linux machine is similar to debugging JavaScript - <code>print</code>s everywhere. When I was debugging and running the tests, I noticed that they take too much time. I started reading the documentation (<code>swift test --help</code>) in search of a better solution. It turned out that <code>swift test</code> has an option to run only the tests that match the given regex - excellent!</p>

<pre><code class="language-swift">swift test --filter &quot;testInstallingRemoteScriptWithDependenciesUsingRegularGithubURL&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>Now I could have even quicker feedback loop on the changes I&rsquo;ve made.</p>

<h1 id="finding-the-real-problem">Finding the <em>real</em> problem</h1>

<p>A few checks later I found out that there is a difference between manually cloning the repo and installing the script vs installing the script by using an URL - the former did work, and the latter didn&rsquo;t 😅</p>

<p>This way I isolated my test case to just one function. A few moments later I found out that somehow Linux version of <code>Foundation</code> framework didn&rsquo;t want to fetch the data from the remote location, where the same function on <code>macOS</code> worked fine.</p>

<p>Now I could isolate the problem to one line of code and try to play with it in a <a href="https://developer.apple.com/swift/blog/?id=18">Swift REPL</a> - an environment similar to the LLDB debugger in Xcode.</p>

<h1 id="swift-repl">Swift REPL</h1>

<p>To enter the REPL on Linux you just run the command <code>swift</code> and you&rsquo;re basically ready to go. Oh, unless you want to import a framework like <code>Foundation</code>, then you&rsquo;ll probably see few errors:</p>

<p><center><img src="img/repl_error.png" alt="REPL import error" style="width: 400pt;" /></center></p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/swiftdocker/docker-swift/issues/87">Some smart people on the internet said that this looks like a problem with linker</a>. They even had a solution for <code>Linux Mint</code> - almost similar to mine, but I had to find correct <code>include path</code> for <code>Ubuntu</code> 😅</p>

<pre><code>swift -I /usr/include/clang/4.0.1/include
</code></pre>

<p>This way I could finally <code>import Foundation</code> in <code>REPL</code> and test fetching data from the remote:</p>

<p><img src="img/data_contentsof_0.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>As you can see the data length is 0, which means that there was some problem along the way.  Normally it should <code>throw</code> an error to let me know about it, but it didn&rsquo;t, so right now we have an error, but we are not sure what error this is. Fortunately, there is this &ldquo;old&rdquo; <code>NSData</code> API that I could use to check the error instead:</p>

<p><img src="img/nsdata_error.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Uh&hellip; This was almost as useful to me as <code>data.length = 0</code>. Internet also didn&rsquo;t know much about it. But then I remembered that this part of <code>Foundation</code> should be open-sourced already, so I started looking for an answer <a href="https://github.com/apple/swift-corelibs-foundation/blob/master/Foundation/NSData.swift">there</a>. <a href="https://github.com/apple/swift-corelibs-foundation/blob/master/Foundation/NSData.swift#L401">I found a function</a> that could be responsible for the error, but didn&rsquo;t have energy left to research the underlying problem. For now, I stopped as I&rsquo;m not even sure if it&rsquo;s possible to fix with what we have available to us on GitHub. But if you&rsquo;re feeling brave enough to try, please let me know!</p>

<h1 id="the-hotfix">The hotfix</h1>

<p>The hotfix for this problem was to use a terminal command instead of a <code>Foundation</code> function to save the file. The final decision was to use <code>wget</code> as it&rsquo;s widely popular and available:</p>

<p><center><img src="img/wget_fix.png" alt="Wget fix" /></center></p>

<p>If you are interested in the full PR, <a href="https://github.com/JohnSundell/Marathon/pull/169">this is the one</a>.</p>

<h1 id="a-second-fix">A second fix</h1>

<p>Quickly after the PR was merged, <a href="https://twitter.com/steipete/status/987620693171941376">Peter Steinberger noticed</a> that the fix is non-obvious and in the long term, it might be hard to remember why we did this. This is a very good point, and I&rsquo;m sad that I didn&rsquo;t think about it while making the PR. But still, I could make the improvement PR and <span class="ab"><em>&ldquo;file a radar&rdquo;</em><span class="abtext">Report a bug to Apple</span></span>.</p>

<p>Radars are great and I filled a few of them in the past already. The problem with them is that they are not open by default. To make your radars public, you can use <a href="https://openradar.appspot.com/">OpenRadar</a>. I didn&rsquo;t used it before, but now I wanted to add a comment with the radar ID so in the future people can check the status of this problem. For filling radars I use <a href="https://github.com/br1sk/brisk">Brisk</a>, and if you didn&rsquo;t use it yet, I encourage you to do so!</p>

<p>Then, I finished the PR with the fix and a comment: with both the description of the solution and the <a href="https://openradar.appspot.com/39621032">radar</a> in it:</p>

<p><img src="img/improvement_pr.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Oh, and after the merge I also updated <strong>Danger Swift</strong> and did my first release - it felt incredible:</p>

<p><center><img src="img/first_danger_release.png" style="width: 400pt;" alt="Wget fix" /></center></p>

<p>Hopefully, now I can settle down on finishing <strong>DangerXiblint</strong>&hellip; ;-)</p>
